# Notes

Just a place to put my idea until I implement them or give up on them.

## Settings

Make a settings screen, stored to local storage that allows you to adjust the following:

- Level population
-- Easy
-- Normal
-- Hard
- Factoroid Behavior
-- Default
-- Splinter
- Prime Highlight
-- If true prime factoroids are golden instead of blue.
