# Notes

Just a place to put my idea until I implement them or give up on them.

## Power up Ideas

- Omega - Breaks the factoroid into its constituent primes
- X - Finds the largest prime in the level, highlights the asteroid in gold, loads the bullet.
- Freeze - Stops the motion of all asteroids

# Settings

Make a settings screen, stored to local storage that allows you to adjust the following:

- Level population
-- Easy
-- Normal
-- Hard
- Factoroid Behavior
-- Default
-- Splinter
- Prime Highlight
-- If true prime factoroids are golden instead of blue.
