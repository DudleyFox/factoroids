# Factoroids
Asteroids clone using prime factors to break down the "factoroids".

## Backstory
The year is 3001, and the crypto miners have used up all the numbers on Earth. As a trusted member of the Elite Space Division Corps you must take your trusty ship Zeta into Reimann Space and find more numbers for the citizens of Earth! Go forth and divide!

## Object
Collect the Factoroids by hitting them with their prime factors.

## Controls:
WASD is movement. `S` is actually for Special, but right now it only flips your ship.

Press number keys to load a bullet.

Use \<backspace\>, `-`, or `/` to unload a bullet

\<enter\>, \<space\>, or `+` to fire a bullet.

The `-`, `/`, and `+` controls work well with a number pad if your keyboard has that.


# Proof of Concept

This is currently in the proof of concept phase. If you want to try it out, clone the repo and load the `index.html` file from the `poc` folder in your favorite browser. That should give you an idea of how it will work.
