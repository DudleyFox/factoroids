# Factoroids
Asteroids clone using prime factors to break down the "factoroids".

## Backstory
The year is 3001, and the crypto miners have used up all the numbers on Earth. As a trusted member of the Elite Space Division Corps you must take your trusty ship Zeta into Reimann Space and find more numbers for the citizens of Earth! Go forth and divide!

## Object
Collect the Factoroids by hitting them with their prime factors.

## Controls:
WASD is movement. `S` is for Special it invokes the current power up.

Press number keys to load a bullet.

Use \<backspace\>, `-`, or `/` to unload a bullet

\<enter\>, \<space\>, or `+` to fire a bullet.

The `-`, `/`, and `+` controls work well with a number pad if your keyboard has that.
